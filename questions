1. Date/time in output differs?
2. How is rec_len calculated by img file? Seems spurious...
3. Not working on lnxsrv
4. Only print directories or files also?
5. Recursively parse subdirectories?
6. Use of BYTE_SIZE
7. Indirection implementation
8. Weird block sizes (that aren't power of 2)? - any rounding? ceil/truncate
9. What to do with files?
10.Symlinks?
