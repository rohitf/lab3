1. Date/time in output differs?
2. How is rec_len calculated by img file? Seems spurious...
DONE Not working on lnxsrv
4. Only print directories or files also?
5. Recursively parse subdirectories?
6. Use of BYTE_SIZE
7. Indirection implementation
8. Weird block sizes (that aren't power of 2)? - any rounding? ceil/truncate
9. What to do with files? Just print id  blocks right?
10. Edge case handling
    - unallocated blocks containing valid data
    - files with data beyond their length
    - files with long names
    - files with syntactically strange or non-ASCII names
10.Symlinks?
11. pread returns too less size
