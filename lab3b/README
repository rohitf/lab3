lab3a.c contains our code for navigating through the Ext2 filesystem and printing summaries of its contents
including Superblock and Group summary, list of free blocks, list of free inodes, list of indoes with 
directory entries and indirect entries at those inodes.

lab3a.c #includes the header file ext2_fs.h



Makefile has the targets:

default - for compiling the lab3a.c to an executable lab3a 
dist    - for creating a tarball lab3a-904599241.tar.gz with lab3a.c, the Makefile and the README
clean   - for getting rid of the executable and the tarball
